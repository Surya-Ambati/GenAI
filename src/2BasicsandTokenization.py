# Tokenization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens.
# These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters, depending on the level of granularity required for the analysis.

or

Tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens.
Tokens are the building blocks of text data and can be words, subwords, or characters. 
Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP as it helps in breaking down text into manageable pieces for further processing.

Tokenization can be performed using various techniques, including whitespace tokenization, punctuation-based tokenization, and more advanced methods like subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding or WordPiece).
Tokenization is often the first step in NLP pipelines, as it prepares the text data for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

# Tokenization is essential for converting unstructured text data into structured data that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
# It helps in identifying the boundaries of words and phrases, allowing for better understanding and analysis of the text.
# Tokenization also plays a crucial role in feature extraction, as it enables the creation of numerical representations of text data, such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF vectors.
# Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP that sets the stage for more complex tasks, such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
# It is a critical component of any NLP pipeline, as it allows for the transformation of raw text into a format that can be easily analyzed and understood by machines.

example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = example_text.split()  # Simple whitespace tokenization
print(tokens)  # Output: ['Hello,', 'world!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization.']
# Output: ['Hello,', 'world!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization.']
# Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP as it helps in breaking down text into manageable pieces for further processing.

example for tokenization:
# 1. Word Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.
example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = example_text.split()  # Simple whitespace tokenization


# 2. Sentence Tokenization: Splitting text into individual sentences.
example for sentence tokenization:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the Punkt tokenizer models
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = example_text.split('. ')  # Simple sentence tokenization
print(tokens)  # Output: ['Hello, world!', 'This is a sample text for tokenization.']
# Output: ['Hello, world!', 'This is a sample text for tokenization.']
# Sentence tokenization is useful for tasks like summarization and sentiment analysis, where understanding the context of sentences is important.



# 3. Subword Tokenization: Splitting words into smaller units (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding).

example for subword tokenization:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the Punkt tokenizer models
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = word_tokenize(example_text)  # NLTK word tokenization
print(tokens)  # Output: ['Hello', ',', 'world', '!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization', '.']
# Output: ['Hello', ',', 'world', '!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization', '.']
# Subword tokenization is useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words and improving the performance of language models.



# 4. Character Tokenization: Splitting text into individual characters.

example for character tokenization:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the Punkt tokenizer models
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = list(example_text)  # Character tokenization
print(tokens)  # Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', ' ', 'T', 'h', 'i', 's', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'a', ' ', 's', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e', ' ', 't', 'e', 'x', 't', ' ', 'f', 'o', 'r', ' ', 't', 'o', 'k', 'e', 'n', 'i', 'z', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n', '.',]
# Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', ' ', 'T', 'h', 'i', 's', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'a', ' ', 's', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e', ' ', 't', 'e', 'x', 't', ' ', 'f', 'o', 'r', ' ', 't', 'o', 'k', 'e', 'n', 'i', 'z', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n']  
# Character tokenization is useful for tasks like text generation and language modeling, where understanding the structure of words is important.


# 5. Regular Expression Tokenization: Using regex patterns to define token boundaries.

example for regex tokenization:

import re
example_text = "Hello, world! This is a sample text for tokenization."
tokens = re.findall(r'\w+', example_text)  # Regex tokenization
print(tokens)  # Output: ['Hello', 'world', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization']
# Output: ['Hello', 'world', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'for', 'tokenization']
# Regular expression tokenization is useful for custom tokenization rules, such as handling special characters or specific patterns in text.


# 6. Whitespace Tokenization: Splitting text based on whitespace characters.
